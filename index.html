          <p class="lead mb-5">
            There is a mismatch between student expectations and the realities of living in rented accomodation.
            We found that 9 in 10 students had problems in their accomodation that needed fixing, and 60% had problems that it taken more than 4 days to get fixed.

          <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-1">
            StuRent is an information product for 1st and 2nd year students at Bristol University looking to move into private rented accommodation in Clifton, Redland or Stokes Croft in the following academic year. It contains:

          <ul class="lead mb-5">
            <li>I developed my research skills by validating the problem, performing desk research and interviewing students and landlords about their experiences.</li>
            <li>We synthesised our insights from research into a proof of problem report helped us to analyse the root causes of the issues and determine a series of solutions.</li>
            <li>Testing these solutions with potential users we arrived at a mixture of several ideas, the physical kit and digital platform.</li>
            <li>We created an awareness campaign in the form of a video and website to test whether this iteration of the product would be desirable.</li>
            <li>Throughout this process, I both advised other teams on how they could improve their products and tweaked this product following expert advice.</li>

          <p class="lead mb-5">
            Current education system in self-awareness, well-being and life skills is failing young people who need it.
            With the biggest youth cohort in human history, 1.8 billion people, scalability is essential as current institutions are failing to keep up with demand.
            We found that 76% of young people feel their school does not prepare them for life.
          </p>
          <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            Merudite is a digital tool for personalised mental wellbeing and life skills education.
            It offers young people a way to independently learn and engage with learning materials that are uniquely tailored to their personality type.
            This helps them to enhance or compensate for their unique strengths and weaknesses.
            It also provides institutions with tools to track the progress of those in their care in a scalable digital way.

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <ul class="lead mb-5">
            <li>The initial version of this idea was to provide a place where students could share the content they were learning from.</li>
            <li>When my co-founder resigned due to personal issues, I continued working on this idea and found a new co-founder.</li>
            <li>I built a team to tackle this problem, finding an expert in the wellbeing sector who has since joined us as a founding member.</li>
            <li>I have successfully acquired around £1500 to explore this idea so far, from various entrepreneurship competitions.</li>
            <li>I built the whole website using Node, Express, Postgres, Bootstrap and some jQuery, and deployed it with Heroku.</li>
            <li>Website is available at <a href="https://merudite.herokuapp.com/">https://merudite.herokuapp.com/</a></li>
            <li>We conducted a trial of the product with Headstart Newham in July 2019, and have been iteratively improving it since.</li>
            <li>For the past 3 months I have been participating in Natwest's Startup Pre-Accelerator Programme with this business.</li>

          <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

            A piece of software that can synthesise and stylise new 3D assets, learning from the data which creative companies have stored in order to create new designs.
            Using techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Transfer Learning, we believe this problem is solvable with AI methods.
